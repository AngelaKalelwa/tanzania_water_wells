    "### Project Overview\n",
    "Tanzania, a developing country, faces significant challenges in providing clean water to its population of over 57 million people.\n",
    "The project aims to develop a classification model to predict the conditions of water wells in Tanzania.The classifier will analyze various features to determine whether a well is functional, needs repair or has failed. By addressing this classification problem, we can assist in identifying wells that require maintenance  and replacement and ensure better allocation of resources for the construction of new wells to ensure access to safe water."

    "### Business Problem\n",
    "Tanzania faces challenges in providing clean water to its large population. Despite numerous established water points, many wells have become non-functional or require repair, leading to water scarcity in certain regions.\n",
    "The goal is to build a machine learning model that can predict the condition of wells, helping identify which wells are at risk of failure. This will help organizations take proactive steps to maintain and repair wells before they become non-functional to improve water access."

    "### Stakeholders\n",
    "1. **NGOs**: Non-governmental organizations working to provide clean water access and support well maintenance.\n",
    "2. **Government of Tanzania**: Agencies involved in infrastructure planning, water management, and public health, aiming to optimize resource distribution for new well construction and repairs.\n",
    "3. **Local Communities**: The populations directly relying on the wells for access to clean water, whose health and well-being depend on the functionality of these water sources.\n",
    "4. **Donors and International Aid Organizations**: Entities funding water projects and requiring data-driven insights to ensure their resources are allocated effectively."
